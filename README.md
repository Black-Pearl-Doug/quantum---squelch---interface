# Quantum Squelch Interface 🧠💨🌈

A Python 3 GUI that simulates quantum tunneling squelch events, analyzes FFT fart harmonics, and logs mnemonic emotional payloads. Inspired by the Quantum Whoopie Cushion vessel and QGED framework.

## Features
- 🌈 Rainbow mnemonic logic with angular symmetry
- 💨 Squelch discharge simulation
- 📉 FFT harmonic analysis
- ❄️🔥 Thermodynamic emotional gradient
- 💽 Mnemonic archive logging
- 🧭 LCARS-style interface

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-squelch-interface.git
cd quantum-squelch-interface
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
