README.md# Quantum Squelch Interface 🧠💨🌈

A Python 3 GUI that simulates quantum tunneling squelch events, analyzes FFT fart harmonics, and logs mnemonic emotional payloads. Inspired by the Quantum Whoopie Cushion vessel and QGED framework, this LCARS-style dashboard is a living archive node for emotional resonance and mechanical fidelity.

## 🚀 Features
- 🌈 Rainbow mnemonic logic with angular symmetry
- 💨 Squelch discharge simulation via sinusoidal waveforms
- 📉 FFT harmonic analysis mapped to emotional payloads
- ❄️🔥 Thermodynamic gradient linking temperature to mnemonic intensity
- 💽 Mnemonic archive logging with symbolic glyphs
- 🧭 LCARS-style interface with diagnostic overlays

## 🛠 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-squelch-interface.git
cd quantum-squelch-interface
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
